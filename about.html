    <h1 id="mq-h1">Get to know the Goods</h1>
    <p id="mq-p" >Our family has been working with antiques for over 25 years in the southwestern Wisconsin area and is proud to have
    opened our first storefront in East Troy. We believe antiques are uniquely crafted with quality, telling the history of
    a time, place and people. Each piece we uncover or refurbish highlights the integrity of that history. Our hope is
    that the piece you fall in love with becomes a focal point of a story in your home.<br><br>
    Our story began when Christine Good brought home here very first antique trunk, purchased from Antiques on
    Main in East Troy. Her love for antiques inspired Tim Good, her husband, to find pieces and refurbish them. They
    decorated their home, trading and upgrading pieces. Antique-ing became a hobby of theirs and they began selling
    at local shows. Soon, they were teaching their kids, and later grandkids, the trick of the trade, passing an
    appreciation for the furniture. We all love antiques for reasons that are personal, but the common thread is that
    they remind us of moments shared together.<br><br>
    Just as we believe these memories will last forever, we stand behind craftsmanship and quality of antiques. Old
    growth wood is sturdy and cannot be reproduced. Original painted surfaces have withstood that test of time.
    These handcrafted pieces have been built with a care and precision that lasts. Your investment tells a story of the
    past, but it also can be passed down generations.</p>

          <p id="mq-p" >I love the look and feel of antiques. The designs are unique and
          one-of-a-kind. I love that they provide this special sense of character
          to a home. They are inviting and give warmth to any room. It’s why I have
          loved decorating my home with them. </p>

          <p id="mq-p" >I love finding the antiques and preserving their history. Over the
          years, I've learned about the pieces, the people who owned them, and how they
          were built. I enjoy reading about them and studying their design. I
          collect hardware, wood, knobs and more so that I can bring them back
          to their original state.</p>

          <p id="mq-p" >I love the thrill of the find. I get to save a piece of our history from
          getting destroyed while traveling and meeting new people. The freedom to find
          antiques and not be on a schedule is fun. Every time I go somewhere, I get to
          learn something new. You can never know it all. It’s interesting to examining
          the craftsmanship before electricity was on the scene. That is woodworking.</p>

          <p id="mq-p" >I love that you can learn so much about American furniture through antiques.
           They tell a story of the people and place. They share where people settled,
           when they migrated and how culture their culture evolved. I enjoy the unique
           craftsmanship, and I get to travel and explore history through each piece.</p>

          <p id="mq-p" >I loved growing up watching dad in the shop working on an antique he or mom
          found. He would share with me the history and details of the craftsmanship.
          Each piece had a story and I couldn’t wait to hear the next one. There began my
          love of antiques. The pieces I find and the people I meet make this journey special.
          I strive to give our salvaged pieces the same story as our antiques. Each reclaimed
          piece receives a new life. For me, being able to keep that alive in the pieces we
          work on and sell means the stories never have to end. </p>

          <h2 id="mq-h2">Kristie Conklin</h2>
          <p id="mq-p" >I love antiques because they tell a story, are made with quality, and were
          built for function. I found my very first antique with my uncle while digging
          holes in my grandparent's lawn in search of buried treasure. (I can’t believe
          I found something!!) Most of the antiques I own tell a story of time spent with
          family, an adventure, or a lesson learned. I also love them because they were
          built with the best wood by craftsmen who designed it with a purpose in mind.
          I see too many people my age spending money on particle board, which they
          throw in the garbage the moment it’s out of style. Antiques are
          unique, and if they no longer fit your life, you can resell them for,
          generally, more than what you paid. </p>
